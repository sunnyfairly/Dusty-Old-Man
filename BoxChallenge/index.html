<p><h2>Boba Fett says you're cool!</h2>

Boba Fett was a Mandalorian warrior and bounty hunter. He was the only unaltered clone of the famed Jango Fett, created in 32 BBY as unit A0050, one of the first of many Fett replicas designed to become part of the Grand Army of the Republic, and was raised as Jango's son. Jango taught Boba much, training him to become a skilled bounty hunter as was his father-figure before him. In 22 BBY, Jango was killed at the Battle of Geonosis, which opened the Clone Wars. Just a boy, Boba was forced to grow up and took to traveling the galaxy. Later, he became a bounty hunter and took assignments from beings such as Jabba the Hutt, and achieved notoriety despite his young age. </p>

<p>When the Empire was formed in 19 BBY, it was the perfect environment for Fett. During this time, he also married Sintas Vel and had a daughter named Ailyn Vel. Fett became known as the galaxy's best bounty hunter of the next several decades, often working for the Empire. He collaborated with Darth Vader on several occasions, and the Sith Lord even developed a grudging respect for Fett. </p>

<p>In 1 BBY, a year after the Galactic Civil War had begun, Fett was hired to kidnap the Rebel captain Juno Eclipse in order to lure out a clone of Galen Marek. Fett participated in the Battle of Kamino and when Darth Vader was captured and about to be interrogated on Dantooine, the Mandalorian bounty hunter trailed the Rogue Shadow there.</p>

<p>Fett made his most notable bounty in 3 ABY, when he captured Rebel hero Han Solo, and delivered him to Jabba the Hutt. A year later, during the Battle of the Great Pit of Carkoon, Fett fought against the group of Rebel rescuers. However, he was inadvertently knocked into the mouth of the Sarlacc by Solo. Though no one in recorded history had ever escaped from the Sarlacc, Fett was able to escape, though not unscathed. Thanks to his iron will and Mandalorian armor, he was able to fight his way out of the beast's belly. Back in action, he resumed his work as a bounty hunter. </p>

<p>After a promise made to a dying Fenn Shysa, Fett became Mandalore and eventually led the Mandalorians through the Yuuzhan Vong War. Originally working as a mercenary for the extra-galactic invaders, Fett later aided the New Republic in their battle against the aliens. When the Yuuzhan Vong assaulted Mandalore and bombarded the planet's surface, a large deposit of Mandalorian iron was unearthed, ironically helping to strengthen the Mandalorians. Later, during the Second Galactic Civil War, Boba, who was still leading the Mandalorians, was plagued by ailing health. He found his granddaughter, Mirta Gev, and the two went on many missions together, even alongside Han Solo. Fett also trained Solo's daughter Jaina to kill her twin brother, Darth Caedus, and assisted the Jedi Coalition in several battles. Ultimately, Fett's training helped Jaina bring down Caedus, though an Imperial nanovirus attack prevented Fett from ever returning to Mandalore. </p>

<div class="meat">
<p>Boba was created by Kaminoans as an unaltered clone, at the request of his father, Jango Fett, before the start of the Clone Wars. He was intended to be both Jango's heir and "Jaster's legacy." As a young boy, Fett grew up on the planet Kamino. Jango raised and cared for him with the assistance of the Kaminoan, Taun We, who ultimately took on the role of being a foster mother to him. Fett was aware of the fact that he was a clone of his father, however, he would often question his conception. Jango assured his son that he was a "true clone" and his real son. Along with the Clawdite Zam Wesell, Taun We was the sole female influence in the young Fett's life. He was known to the Null-ARC Captain Ordo as a "little jerk". </p>

<p>As a child Boba never attended school at all; instead he gained much knowledge from his travels with his father and the books he borrowed from the local library. Boba was very fond of books, especially those about starfighters, which he often borrowed and read from the library of Tipoca City. Sometime before the Clone Wars, Boba met Sith Lord Count Dooku (Darth Tyranus), who had hired his father to take up bounties that would be beneficial to him and his master in the events that followed. On one such mission Boba accompanied Jango to the planet of Kuat, where Jango used the boy as bait to lure his bounty into the open. Afraid, the young Fett threw a thermal detonator and fled into the tents. Once he located the boy, the colonist was horrified to learn the young boy was the son of the man sent to kill him. Jango, having finished assassinating the remaining members of the camp, tracked down Boba and demanded that Larbo release his son, slashing his way through the tent's canopy. Disgusted, Larbo asked what kind of man would use his own son as bait, and Boba replied, "Only a son can know his father's heart". After killing his bounty, Boba escaped with his father on their ship and informed the Count of their successful mission. Boba would often accompany his father to the training sessions with the other clones where he taught them basic combat skills. </p>

<p>The chance to see Obi-Wan Kenobi's Delta-7 was a relished opportunity considering his love for vehicles. Boba was roughly ten years old when Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi came to Kamino to investigate the assassination attempts on Senator Padmé Amidala, also uncovering the secret creation of a clone army for the Republic in the process. Fett's father, Jango, ordered for Fett to close his closet door containing his armor in the Mandalorian language before allowing himself to undergo questioning by the Jedi. Jango afterwards realized that he and his son would have to leave Kamino before the Jedi unraveled his involvement in the assassination attempt. After Jango and Obi-Wan fought, Jango and Boba blasted off the planet in their ship, Slave I. </p>

<p>En route to Geonosis, they realized that Kenobi had tracked them. Boba encouraged and intently watched his father attempt to destroy the Jedi. He eventually watched what they thought was the death of Kenobi, although Kenobi had actually let loose the spare part compartments, making the missile that was tracking him blow up. Obi-Wan had actually hid on an asteroid. As the Battle of Geonosis started, Boba stood with Jango on the platform in the Petranaki arena with several Separatist leaders, including Count Dooku, Viceroy Nute Gunray, and Archduke Poggle the Lesser. When Jedi Master Mace Windu arrived, Jango kept Boba from harm as the Jedi task force attempted to rescue the captive Obi-Wan, Anakin Skywalker, and Padmé Amidala. During the battle, Boba watched his father get trampled by a reek, and, as a result, eventually beheaded by Mace Windu when Jango attempted to challenge him. While the Grand Army of the Republic and the Separatist Droid Army clashed for the very first time, Boba emerged from his hiding place to pick up his father's helmet. Boba swore revenge on Mace Windu, for this reason.
